The docker setup does not work as in a normal Linux machine, on a Mac it is much more complicated. But it can be done!

brew install --cask docker virtualbox 
brew install docker-machine
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
docker-machine restart
eval "$(docker-machine env default)" # This might throw an TSI connection error. In that case run docker-machine regenerate-certs default
(docker-machine restart) # maybe needed
docker run hello-world
